title: "life in a jar"

This website is for all the spider lovers out there. I personally love them, I have had many pet jumping spiders but just today my dad told me I could make a blog about my current spider, Wally, and all of the future jumping spiders to come.  Just so you know I don't have any other types of spiders as pets I only have jumping spiders and I can not tell the difference between male and female. I just hope all of my jumping spiders all have a long happy life.
