# About 
Wally is probably a asiatic wall jumping spider. He is **VERY** crazy, and likes to jump alot.His favorite spot to hang out is on the top of the lid. I found him on the right side of our shed which is a common place for us to find jumping spiders. I don't think I have ever found an asiatic wall jumper but I hope I find more. Wally is the first spider I am  writting about.

today at 10:30 am I caught Wally and I got a few pictures of him. I have a few goals I want to achieve including getting him on my hand natraully, and getting him to trust me. I only have 6 days with him because I am going on a trip for a few weeks. I hope he will get used to his home for a little while. he ate all 3 ants in his jar, what a pig! I will have to refill his food tommorow.

At first when I came to check on him I could not find him, we thought that had escaped. Then we found he was just jumping around. he has been hanging out on the lid for a while. I was about to open the jar but then I saw him and decided not to open it.I'm thinking about putting more stuff in his jar not just a few weed stems. A little later we changed his jar because it was to small and I could not see very well. We also gave him some more ants and I hope we will not need to refill anytime soon.

I checked on him later in the afternoon today to find him sleeping on the end of a plants branch. It was one of the cutest things I have ever seen!At first I thought he was dead.  But I accidently bumped the jar and he had fell off the branch. Today I just realized how tiny he is compared to Ziggy.

Wally made a nice tiny web he looked very cozy, I thought he was a fly and Wally was hiding somewhere else. But he wasn't and even though I already said this but Wally is TINY! I love him and its so cute that he is so tiny. anyways I realize that I only have 2 days left with him.

day:5 6/28/25

Today it took me awhile to find him because I was looking on the walls and plants, but then I remebered he had a web so I looked on the lid and I still couldn't find him. I took a second and then saw that he was on the lid sideways and it was kinda funny and he looked like he was saying "yes, whose there?" I'm really glad I got to learn about Wally because tommorow I have to release him. Although I can do one more noticing at least.

day:6 6/29/25

Today I found Wally and it looked like he might have molted and thats why he had a cocoon looking web, so he could molt in there. I came up with an idea since I do have to go on a trip and cant check on them I htought I had to let them go but now I could just open the lid and have the jar on its side so he can chose if he wants to leave and if he does he can come back.
