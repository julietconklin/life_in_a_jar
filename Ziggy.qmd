Day:1 6/25/25

Today I caught Ziggy at around 12:30 pm.He was pretty big so I thought he would be a fun pet. He is pretty chill in his jar right now. I hope he doesnt mind that Wally is nearby. They are not in the same jar but they are really close to each other. He is super funny to watch because he keeps trying to climb the side of the jar and not on the plant and keeps falling off. 

Day:2 6/26/25

 Today Ziggy was happily hanging out at the bottom of the jar. I just named him today because I did not think of one yesterday. He was kinda staring at the ants and it was pretty funny. I did not see very many ants in the jar but there were tons when we put them in yesterday. I bet that most of them are just hiding trying not to get eaten. I wonder if Ziggy is used to the jar yet. I hope so.

 Day:3 6/27/25

 Ziggy seemed to be stalking an ant. He was under the ant and the ant didn't even notice him. When I opened the jar because I couldn't find him I found him and in a second he noticed me and stared at me it was really cute. I wonder if he likes his home in the jar I mean it has free food and shelter from pretadors.


Day:4 6/28/25

I found Ziggy hanging out on the walls he apparently learned how to climb the walls. When we first had him he kept falling off and it was kinda funny. Before I could find him I saw the flying bug that I caught for him and for a second I thought that the flying bug was him. I'm glad I got to learn more about him because we have to let him go tommorow but at least I will be able notice one more thing about him.

Day:5 6/29/25

Today Ziggy was hanging out on a plant and it was super cute he was right over an ant. Yedsterday I thought today would be my last day with them but I might be able to look at them again but I also have an idea about keeping the lid open and the jar on its side so they can chose if they want to leave and if they don't want to they wont have rain in the jar.
