I personally love them, I have had many pet jumping spiders but just today my dad told me I could make a blog about my current spider, Wally, and all of the future jumping spiders to come. Just so you know I don’t have any other types of spiders as pets I only have jumping spiders and I can not tell the difference between male and female. I just hope all of my jumping spiders all have a long happy life."

    "text": "Wally\n\n\n\nAbout\nWally is probably a asiatic wall jumping spider. He is VERY crazy, and likes to jump alot.His favorite spot to hang out is on the top of the lid. I found him on the right side of our shed which is a common place for us to find jumping spiders. I don’t think I have ever found an asiatic wall jumper but I hope I find more. Wally is the first spider I am writting about.\n\n\ngoals\n\ngoing on my hand natraully\ngetting him to trust me\n\n\n\nBlog\nday:1 6/24/25\ntoday at 10:30 am I caught Wally and I got a few pictures of him. I have a few goals I want to achieve including getting him on my hand natraully, and getting him to trust me. I only have 6 days with him because I am going on a trip for a few weeks. I hope he will get used to his home for a little while. he ate all 3 ants in his jar, what a pig! I will have to refill his food tommorow.\nday:2 6/25/25\nAt first when I came to check on him I could not find him, we thought that had escaped. Then we found he was just jumping around. he has been hanging out on the lid for a while. I was about to open the jar but then I saw him and decided not to open it.I’m thinking about putting more stuff in his jar not just a few weed stems. A little later we changed his jar because it was to small and I could not see very well. We also gave him some more ants and I hope we will not need to refill anytime soon.\nday:3 6/26/25\nI checked on him later in the afternoon today to find him sleeping on the end of a plants branch. It was one of the cutest things I have ever seen!At first I thought he was dead. But I accidently bumped the jar and he had fell off the branch. Today I just realized how tiny he is compared to Ziggy."
